    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>A company profile is an introduction to your business, and aims to tell an audience about your products or services.
         However, a company profile shouldn't just tell your audience what you sell -- it should also tell viewers why you sell it.
         A company profile often includes a compelling story about how the company began, as well as the company's vision and values.</p>
