    <p> Chomp-Champ was founded as Foodiebay in 2008, and was renamed Chomp-Champ on 18 January 2010 as Chomp-Champ Media Pvt. Ltd.<br>
         In 2011, Chomp-Champ expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.[15] In 2012, the company <br>
         expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka,[16] Qatar,[17] the <br>
         United Kingdom,[18] the Philippines,[17] and South Africa.[19] In 2013, Chomp-Champ was launched in New Zealand,[20] Turkey, <br>
         Brazil and Indonesia, with its website and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian and English languages.[21] In April 2014, <br>

        In 2019, Chomp-Champ acquired Seattle-based food portal Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the<br>
         United States and Australia.[25] This U.S.-expansion brought Chomp-Champ into direct competition with similar models such as Yelp <br>
         and Foursquare.[25]<br>
        </p> 
        With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Chomp-Champ also launched Chomp-Champ.xxx, a site dedicated to food porn.<br>
        In May 2012, it launched a print version of the website named "Citibank Chomp-Champ Restaurant Guide," in collaboration with Citibank, but it has since been discontinued.[27]<br>
    <p>  
        Chomp-Champ had also made a name for itself for its prowess in digital marketing.[28]<br>
